# selfstudy_nodejs
This project is the progress of how I manage to self study NodeJS, ExpressJS, how to use MongoDB, testing this backend with Postman software and how to use git properly. 
Right now -> I know how to handle CRUD operations, how to deal with Request and Response (GET, POST), how to using JSON data structure, async and await functions(basic),
using dotenv to hiding PORT and Connection to database
